title: Lexical Scope
---

Lexical context (also called lexical scope) refers to where variables and functions are declared in the source code, which determines what data they can access. This is a foundational concept for understanding how JavaScript resolves variable names, closures, and function behavior.

## üîç What is Lexical Context?

* ‚ÄúLexical‚Äù means related to the **position in code** (at the time of writing the code).
* Lexical context is created whenever:
    * A **function** is declared.
	* A **block** ({}) is used (with let or const).
	* A **module** is defined.

Each lexical context defines a **scope**: a boundary within which variables are visible and accessible.

## üß† Lexical Scoping

JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, which means:

A variable‚Äôs scope is determined **at the time of writing** the code (not during runtime), based on its **position in the code structure**.

```js
function outer() {
  let outerVar = 'I am from outer';

  function inner() {
    let innerVar = 'I am from inner';

    console.log(outerVar); // ‚úÖ can access outerVar
    console.log(innerVar); // ‚úÖ can access innerVar
  }

  inner();
  console.log(innerVar); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
}

outer();
```

### Closure Example

```js
function counter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const increment = counter();

increment(); // 1
increment(); // 2
```

* The inner function ‚Äúremembers‚Äù the lexical context in which it was created (counter()).
* Even after counter() finishes execution, the returned function still has access to count.

## Nested Lexical Contexts (Scope Chain)

Each function or block can nest within another. When accessing variables, JavaScript searches up the lexical scope chain.
```js
let globalVar = 'global';

function a() {
  let aVar = 'a';

  function b() {
    let bVar = 'b';

    console.log(globalVar); // ‚úÖ
    console.log(aVar);      // ‚úÖ
    console.log(bVar);      // ‚úÖ
  }

  b();
}

a();
```

Here, b() has access to:
* bVar (its own scope)
* aVar (from a)
* globalVar (from global scope)

## Lexical Scope in Arrow Functions

Arrow functions inherit the lexical scope of their surrounding code ‚Äî just like regular functions do.

```js
const outer = () => {
  const outerVar = 'from outer';

  const inner = () => {
    console.log(outerVar); // ‚úÖ accessible due to lexical scope
  };

  inner();
};

outer();
```

inner is defined inside outer, so it has access to variables in outer‚Äôs lexical context.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Arrow Functions and this (lexical this)

Unlike regular functions, arrow functions **do not have their own this**. They inherit this from the lexical context where they are defined.
```js
function Timer() {
  this.seconds = 0;

  setInterval(() => {
    this.seconds++;
    console.log(this.seconds);
  }, 1000);
}
```

* The arrow function inside setInterval does not bind its own this.
* It uses this from Timer‚Äôs context, which is the instance of Timer.

Compare this with a regular function:
```js
function Timer() {
  this.seconds = 0;

  setInterval(function () {
    this.seconds++; // ‚ùå 'this' is not the Timer instance
    console.log(this.seconds);
  }, 1000);
}
```
The regular function has its **own this**, which refers to the global object (window in browsers), not the Timer instance.

### ‚ùå Arrow Functions Cannot Be Constructors

Because arrow functions do not have their own lexical context for this, you cannot use new with them:
```js
const Person = (name) => {
  this.name = name;
};

const p = new Person('Alice'); // ‚ùå TypeError: Person is not a constructor
```
